# 2048-game-python
An implementation of the 2048 game in Python with a GUI

This is an implementation of the 2048 game written in Python with a graphical user interface using Python's built in tkinter module.

This software was developed by kovacsgergo128, mateRajnai and me (bpolgardy) as part of our first project at Codecool Budapest.

It started out as a command-line application which then evolved into the present GUI version.

The game is still a work in progress and additional features will be added in the future as time allows.
